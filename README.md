# ai-powered-projectmanagement
Purpose: Create a system where multiple AI agents collaborate to manage a software project, handling tasks like code analysis, task prioritization, and team communication. 

Here we use:

MCP to connect agents to external tools/data (e.g., GitHub for code, Notion for tasks).
A2A to enable agent-to-agent communication (e.g., a code agent talks to a task agent).
LangGraph to orchestrate the workflow and manage stateful interactions.
